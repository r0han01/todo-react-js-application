Todo React JS Application
A simple and efficient to-do list application built with React. This app allows users to manage their tasks by adding, displaying, and removing items from a list.

Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to the list by typing in the input field and pressing the "Add Task" button.
Remove Tasks: Each task has a "Remove" button to delete it from the list.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Interactive UI: Built with React to create a smooth and dynamic user interface.
Methods Followed:
React Functional Components: Used functional components for a modern approach to building the app.
useState Hook: Managed the list of tasks and input field using Reactâ€™s useState hook to handle state changes.
Event Handling: Handled user input and task removal by passing event handlers to buttons.
Conditional Rendering: Ensured tasks are only added if the input is not empty and handled task deletion dynamically.
Technologies Used:
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
CSS: Custom styles to make the app visually appealing and responsive.
